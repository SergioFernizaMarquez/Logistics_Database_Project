# Logistics_Database_Project
In this project I built and simulate the database for a warehouse that is the supplier of supermarkets. With this simulated data, I can streamline standard restock, payroll and maintenance procedures, and also implement fraud detection. As well I can make data analysis of the data created throughout this project to make projects and visualizations.
